        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p class="indent-para">
            Baked ziti is a comforting and hearty Italian-American dish that satisfies both the stomach and the soul. It starts with al dente ziti pasta, tubular and ribbed, perfect for holding onto the rich flavors of the dish. The pasta is then coated in a velvety marinara sauce, bursting with the tanginess of tomatoes, the sweetness of onions, and the warmth of garlic and herbs. Generous dollops of creamy ricotta cheese are interspersed throughout, adding a luscious creaminess and a hint of tanginess to each bite. Layers of gooey mozzarella cheese blanket the top, creating a golden crust that invites you to dive in. Sometimes, savory Italian sausage or tender meatballs are added, infusing the dish with additional layers of flavor and heartiness. Baked until bubbly and golden brown, the aroma that fills the kitchen is irresistible, promising a meal that's both comforting and utterly satisfying. With its melding of textures and flavors, baked ziti is a timeless classic that brings warmth and joy to any table.
