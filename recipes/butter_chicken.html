        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Butter chicken, also known as "murgh makhani," is a beloved Indian dish renowned for its rich and creamy flavors that tantalize the taste buds. Succulent pieces of tender chicken are marinated in a blend of yogurt and spices, including ginger, garlic, and an array of aromatic spices such as garam masala, cumin, and coriander. After marinating, the chicken is traditionally cooked in a tandoor oven, infusing it with a smoky charred flavor. The star of the dish, however, is the velvety tomato-based sauce, made with a luscious blend of butter, cream, tomato puree, and a medley of spices. This sauce is simmered to perfection, allowing the flavors to meld together and create a harmonious symphony of taste. Once the chicken is cooked, it is gently simmered in the sauce until tender and juicy, absorbing all the creamy goodness. Served with fluffy basmati rice or warm naan bread, butter chicken is a dish that captivates both the senses and the soul, offering a taste of indulgence and comfort with every bite.</p>
